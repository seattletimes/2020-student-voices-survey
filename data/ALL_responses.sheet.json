With everything going on right now with the covid-19 or the protest for blm it can be hard to want to sit and right an essay on Antigone. I don't know what the futures going to look like but all I know is we are apart of it, and personally I'd rathe be talking about what's going on right now than a play written in 441 B.C. All I'm saying is in my most humble and honest opinion there are more important things going on. As for the the folling school year I wouldn't mind if we continued online school, if we go back that's cool too. I think online school has been easier to manage. But if we go back and we have rules to follow such as wearing a mask or being six feet apart, that is not going to do anything. Students don't and will not wear mask, but also we have to many kids to stay six feet apart and even if we had enough room to do that, we wouldn't do it anyways. If we got put back in a building with the rest of our friends we are going to be closer than six feet."

Also I think that all the teachers should have the same way of taking attendance because it’s easier and kids would be less likely to get confused and be marked absent. I think teachers should also send out reminders about homework and when it’s due because some kids might’ve misunderstood directions or due dates or just completely forgotten about the assignment since kids have a lot of other things to do at home. Lastly I think that teachers need to become a little bit better at communicating. Personally my teachers have done a really good job but I know that some of my siblings and friends teachers haven’t been the best. I understand that working from home can be a struggle with distractions and other responsibilities interfering with work but student have to be able to rely on their teachers for clarification and help especially during these times."

Also students that wouldn’t work on their assignments other than homeroom will have their grades reflect that and maybe they should have a talk with their counselor to figure out a personal plan. Fix the school lunches. They are so small that we need a breadstick with half of our meals to even meet the minimum calorie requirement. What happened to Michelle Obama’s movement for a more healthy school. I think that was fixed with smaller lunches instead of more time to exercise. School districts shouldn’t be run by people of the community who have no idea what happens in school. We the students need the right to vote for OUR changes not adults thinking what should change without stepping foot in a school in 30 years. We have good teachers at least at my school and I hate it when they have to tell us that they can’t do something because of red tape or policy. For example my comp sci teacher had car problems then his daughters babysitter cancelled so he was kicked out of school for the day because he had to bring his daughter in and we had someone who had no idea of the topic waste 50 min of our time and their time. Sorry for ranting but my point is that make class time effective and efficient. Short periods to give a topic and then practice on your own time."

In my humble opinion, I think that keeping the state or country closed for such a prolonged period of time is ultimately more detrimental then keeping it open."
